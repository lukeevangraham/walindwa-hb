                            Centre Kamonong</a> (EBCCK) family who are now over the age of 18. These students no longer
                        reside
                        at EBCCK, but are in need of additional education or training in order to secure a job which
                        will support them as an adult. At this point in their life they are facing the cost of any
                        post-secondary education (e.g. trade schools, junior college, and university level), plus their
                        living expenses such as housing fees, food, clothing and any other school requirements.</p>

                    <p>Walindwa fills this gap with the Higher Education Sponsorship program. Students must have a
                        proven record of good academic standing, strong ethics, and be well behaved in order to be
                        included in the pool of candidates. The candidates are interviewed and approved by the EBCCK
                        Board of Directors, before being presented to Walindwa for consideration of a scholarship. Costs
                        range from $1250 to $3000 per year, depending upon the education program in which the student is
                        enrolled.</p>
